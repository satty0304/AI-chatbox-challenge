AI Chatbox Challenge
About this project

This is a simple AI Chatbox backend I built while learning FastAPI.

It supports user login.

Each user can have up to 3 conversations.

I made this project as part of my practice and to showcase my interest in backend development.

I am still learning, but I tried to document everything clearly so anyone can set it up.

Features

✅ User login & authentication
✅ Store conversations in database
✅ Limit of 3 conversations per user
✅ Built using FastAPI and SQLite
