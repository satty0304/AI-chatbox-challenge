I built the backend using FastAPI. Users can sign up / sign in with email, and each user is allowed only 3 conversations at a time (old ones get deleted automatically). I connected it to a sample AI API (OpenAI by default, but it can be swapped with others).

I assumed they just wanted a working backend, so I focused on that part. The repo also has clear setup instructions in the README.
