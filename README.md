I built the backend using FastAPI. Users can sign up / sign in with email, and each user is allowed only 3 conversations at a time (old ones get deleted automatically). I connected it to a sample AI API (OpenAI by default, but it can be swapped with others).

I assumed they just wanted a working backend, so I focused on that part. The repo also has clear setup instructions in the README.

selected the MIT license because it’s the simplest and most common one. It allows others to use the code freely, and I didn’t want to restrict it since this project is mainly for the assignment.
